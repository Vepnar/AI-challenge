# AI-Challenge

I'm trying to solve this challenge [this]("https://github.com/silverbottlep/abid_challenge") without an amazon AWS account.

# First problem
I do not have an Amazon AWS account and I can not create one because it requires credit card information which I don't have. That's why I came up with an alternative.
[this script]("https://github.com/Vepnar/AI-challenge/blob/master/bucket-downloader.sh") Can download all files and metadata from the amazon bucket to my computer without the need of an amazon bucket
